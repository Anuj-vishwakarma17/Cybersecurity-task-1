## 1. Kali Linux
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and cybersecurity tasks. It includes pre-installed tools for scanning, exploitation, packet analysis, and vulnerability assessment.

**Purpose in Lab:**
- Acts as the attacker machine
- Used for traffic analysis, scanning, and testing

---

## 2. Metasploitable2
Metasploitable2 is intentionally vulnerable system used for learning and practicing ethical hacking techniques in a safe environment.

**Purpose in Lab:**
- Acts as the target machine
- Helps understand real-world vulnerabilities without risk

---

## 3. Virtualization (Oracle VirtualBox)
VirtualBox allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine using virtual machines.

**Why Virtualization is Used:**
- Safe testing environment
- No impact on host operating system
- Easy reset and snapshot support

---

## 4. Host-Only Adapter
Host-Only Adapter is a network mode in VirtualBox that allows communication only between the host and virtual machines.

**Advantages:**
- Fully isolated from the internet
- Prevents accidental real-world attacks
- Safe for penetration testing practice

---

## 5. Wireshark
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets in real time.

**Uses:**
- Analyze network traffic
- Identify protocols like ICMP, HTTP, DNS
- Understand packet-level communication

---

## 6. Packet Capture
Packet capture involves monitoring data packets transmitted over a network interface.

**Learning Outcome:**
- Understanding how data travels in a network
- Identifying source and destination IP addresses
- Observing protocol behavior
